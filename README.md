      This is an extension for firefox that will allow videos from a pre-approved list to be shown on the home page.
      It will also remove suggestion tab when video is playing. I made this as I feel youtube has great educational content, but it's hard to
      not fall prey to the reccomendation algorithm and waste time.
      
      I have not released this on the firefox store, you will have to manually install this in firefox. Change array in the hide.js file with the channels and 
      keyworks you want to pass through the filter.
